# unit-4-game
The game is very close to being done but I didn't quite get there.  Currently the code breaks when trying to display the proper number of opponents after both the character and opposition have been chosen. Also once the player wins, the loop counter iterates to 3, and the actions which can then be taken also need to be coded (although they are essentialy the same as when loop=2, hence the reason I spent my time trying to make loop 2 complete, if loop 2 was still malfunctioning, loop 3 wouild as well)

There also was some problems with defining unique id's to some of the actions, originally I had many of the actions operate based on the id of their parent div, however this caused some functions to iterate extra times as elements which had their parents id were triggered extra times. Close...
