# unit-4-game

Correction: the game works now. Lots of extra code needs to be cleaned up. Some extra bonus text when you finally win would be nice. Several of the loops could be optimized better. But it works. Yay!





<!-- The game is very close to being done but I didn't quite get there.  Currently the code breaks when trying to display the proper number of opponents after both the character and opposition have been chosen, as the click triggers both the id = "dogname" as well as the "badguys" div, where the opponent elemnts reside. My solution was the loop counter, which should eliminate soe of the offending triggers as they are loop# dependent. This has been partially implemented.

Also once the player wins, the loop counter iterates to 3, and the actions which can then be taken also need to be coded (although they are essentialy the same as when loop=2, hence the reason I spent my time trying to make loop 2 complete, if loop 2 was still malfunctioning, loop 3 wouild as well)

There also was some problems with defining unique id's to some of the actions, originally I had many of the actions operate based on the id of their parent div, however this caused some functions to iterate extra times as elements which had their parents id were triggered extra times. Close... -->

The code also needs a final cleanup once everything works, many testing elements remain.
